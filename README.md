Source code for Electroblob's Wizardry, a Minecraft mod currently for versions 1.7.10 and 1.10.2. Wizardry adds an RPG-style system of magic spells to Minecraft with the aim of being as playable as possible. No crazy constructs, no perk trees, no complex recipes - simply find spell books, cast spells, and master the arcane!
